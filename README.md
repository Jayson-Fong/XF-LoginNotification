# Login Notification for XenForo 2

Allow your users to enable notifications for when their account is accessed from a new IP address. Notifications are sent by e-mail and members can enable or disable them from the `Password and security` page.

Login notification messages include the IP address and user agent used for the new login. Changing notification preferences requires members to verify their password, and if they have two-factor authentication enabled, successfully pass it.
